# ChessEngine
This is an all-inclusive chess playing program that performs at a level corresponding to the search depth you set.
To use the program, run the Chess.java file which will then consequently print a board to the console.
To make a move, enter the starting square and the ending square of the piece you would like to move eg. e2e4
For castling, input the king's starting square and ending square.
The program will take a long time to perform at high search depths so unless you are on a high performance machine
do not attempt searching very high (stay at or below 5 on personal computers)
